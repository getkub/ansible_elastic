Function,Description,Splunk SPL Example,ESQL Equivalent Status,ESQL Example/Workaround,Notes
summaryindex,"Creates summary data and stores it in a summary index for faster searches","| summaryindex spool=f index=summary_idx | stats count by host","Not Available","Use Transform API or Ingest Pipelines","ESQL doesn't have summary indexes; use Elasticsearch's transform feature or ingest pipelines for pre-aggregation"
join,"Combines results from two searches based on common fields","search index=web | join sessionid [search index=app | fields sessionid, userid]","Not Available","Use multiple FROM clauses with WHERE conditions","ESQL doesn't support JOIN yet; workaround with multiple queries or use regular Elasticsearch queries with terms lookup"
inlinestats/eventstats,"Adds statistical information to each event without changing the number of events","| eventstats avg(response_time) as avg_resp by host","Partial Support","FROM logs | STATS avg_resp = AVG(response_time) BY host | EVAL ...","ESQL STATS groups data; for inline stats, need separate aggregation query or use regular ES aggregations"
jq/json parser,"Extracts and manipulates JSON data within events","| eval parsed=spath(_raw, ""data.user.name"")","Available","FROM logs | EVAL parsed = _raw.data.user.name","ESQL has native JSON field access using dot notation"
macros/functions,"Reusable search fragments defined as macros","``get_failed_logins(index, timeframe)``","Not Available","Create saved queries or use Elasticsearch templates","ESQL doesn't support macros; use saved queries, Elasticsearch query templates, or application-level abstraction"
append,"Appends results from a second search to the first","search index=errors | append [search index=warnings]","Not Available","Use UNION in future versions or multiple queries","ESQL doesn't support APPEND yet; combine at application level or wait for UNION support"
transaction,"Groups events into transactions based on common fields and time proximity","| transaction sessionid startswith=""login"" endswith=""logout"" maxspan=30m","Limited Support","Use EQL sequence queries for time-based event correlation","Use EQL sequence queries for transaction-like behavior, but not as flexible as Splunk's transaction command"
inputlookup/lookupfile,"Loads data from external CSV files or lookup tables","| inputlookup users.csv | where active=""true""","Not Available","Use Elasticsearch indices or enrich policies","Load CSV data into Elasticsearch indices or use enrich processor in ingest pipelines"
subsearch,"Performs a search within another search","search index=web NOT [search index=blocked_ips | fields ip]","Not Available","Use multiple queries with application logic","ESQL doesn't support subsearches; implement with multiple queries and application-level logic"
alert_actions,"Triggers alert actions like email, webhook, or custom notifications directly from search pipeline","| alert_actions email ""to=admin@company.com subject='Alert' message='High CPU detected'""","Not Available","Use Elasticsearch Watcher or Kibana Alerting","ESQL doesn't support inline alert actions; use Watcher API, Kibana alerting rules, or external alerting systems"
alert_actions,"Sends HTTP requests to external APIs as part of search pipeline","| alert_actions webhook ""url=https://api.slack.com/webhook connection=abc""","Not Available","Use Elasticsearch Watcher webhook action or external processing","Configure webhook actions in Watcher or process ESQL results in application layer to trigger webhooks"
